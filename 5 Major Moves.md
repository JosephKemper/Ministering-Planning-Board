## Prompt
Break down this project into five major moves. Assume you are talking to someone who has about a year of programming classes and has built a few small projects and studied independently through several sources, but has never built anything close to this scale. Give the moves in both a summary version and a detailed list. 

## **Summary: Five Major Moves**

1. **Design Core Data Models & Structure**
2. **Build Interactive Drag-and-Drop Board**
3. **Implement Import/Export & Printing Functionality**
4. **Secure Data & Local Processing**
5. **Testing, Quality Assurance, and Future Integration**

## **Detailed Breakdown**

### **1. Design Core Data Models & Structure**

**Summary:**  
Define and structure the data that represents individuals, families, companionships, assignments, and districts.

**Details:**
- Sketch out the main entities: Individual, Family, Companionship, Ministering Assignment, District, Notes.
- Decide on relationships:  
  - Individuals can belong to Families and Companionships.
  - Families can have one or more Individuals.
  - Companionships can have two or more Individuals (default 2).
  - Ministering Assignments link Companionships to Families/Individuals.
  - Districts group assignments and have a person in charge.
- Decide how to store this data (e.g., using local storage, IndexedDB, or JSON files locally).
- Plan for extensibility—so you can add features later without breaking the structure.
- Consider using TypeScript or another typed language to help enforce data integrity.

### **2. Build Interactive Drag-and-Drop Board**

**Summary:**  
Create the visual interface for the board, with draggable cards for each entity and districts as drop-zones.

**Details:**
- Choose a framework for the website (React is highly recommended for drag-and-drop UI).
- Implement draggable “cards” for Individuals, Families, Companionships, Assignments, and Districts.
- Enable the creation of entities by dragging (e.g., drag two ministers together to create a companionship).
- Make cards visually distinct:  
  - Ministers (white), Youth Ministers (pink), People Being Ministered (green), etc.
- Allow cards to be dragged into districts, assignments, families, etc., reflecting the rules you described.
- Add buttons to create entities (companionship, family, assignment) for alternate workflows.
- Add a notes feature to every card/entity.
- Make sure the UI updates in real-time as cards are moved.

### **3. Implement Import/Export & Printing Functionality**

**Summary:**  
Allow users to import lists of names and export or print assignments.

**Details:**
- Build a CSV/Excel (and maybe LDS Tools-format) importer for individuals.
- On import, auto-create minister and individual cards per person.
- Design export functions that generate printable lists of assignments by district.
- Allow exporting in formats suitable for email or paper.
- Build a print-friendly version of the board and lists.
- Make sure exports never send data off the user’s device (client-side only).

### **4. Secure Data & Local Processing**

**Summary:**  
Ensure all data stays local, and provide optional password protection.

**Details:**
- Store all data in local browser storage (IndexedDB is recommended for complex data).
- Make sure nothing is transmitted to external servers.
- Implement a password protection system (simple local encryption—look at libraries like [CryptoJS](https://cryptojs.gitbook.io/docs/)).
- Allow users to set/change passwords and securely store encrypted data.
- Consider auto-locking the app after inactivity.

---

### **5. Testing, Quality Assurance, and Future Integration**

**Summary:**  
Write tests, ensure code quality, and plan for future integration with official LDS tools.

**Details:**
- Write unit tests for all core functions (data manipulation, drag-and-drop, import/export).
- Write integration tests for workflows (creating assignments, moving cards, printing).
- Use tools like Jest (for JavaScript/TypeScript) or your framework’s preferred testing suite.
- Test UI accessibility and responsiveness.
- Document the code clearly for future contributors.
- Plan for scalability—structure code so it can be modular and potentially integrate with LDS tools in the future.
- Consider code review practices and CI/CD pipelines for future collaboration and enterprise-grade standards.

## **How These Moves Fit Together**

- You’ll start by designing how your data is structured, which guides everything else.
- Next, you’ll build the core UI that lets users interact with that data.
- With the basics working, you’ll add import/export and print features so it’s usable in real life.
- Throughout, you’ll keep data secure and local, respecting privacy and trust.
- Finally, you’ll continually test and improve your code, preparing it for possible future integration and professional use.

**Tip:**  
Build incrementally—focus on getting each move working in a basic form before adding extra features or polish. Ask for feedback from your quorum, iterate, and always keep the data safe and local!
