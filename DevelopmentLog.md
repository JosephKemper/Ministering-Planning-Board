Shifting full focus to building this. I will be heavily relying on AI, but I will be following these rules. 

### 5 Rules of Studying/Building with AI

1. Never use the Copy and Paste functionality in any way on your final project. Copying something for later reference is fine, but whenever it is going into the final project, it must be typed directly by you, even if that involves typing it letter for letter for 10,000 lines. 

2. Always ask why. Be like a 3-year-old spitting out that question a million times until you actually understand the reasoning behind what you are doing. 

3. Realize that AI is not perfect and never will be. That means you have to use common sense and or simply test the information you are being given. 

4. Never let yourself go through the motions. You are speeding up your learning journey, you need to bring your best if you are to truly speed up your learning. 

5. Reason out as much as you can. Use AI where needed. Take the information it gives you. Process it, reason it out, ask questions until you can understand it, and then make it your own. Learn with the goal that you will be able to teach the AI, or even your peers, something new. Your brain was created by an all knowing, all powerful God. AI was created by a flawed human. You will be able to quickly get to that point, if you bring your best to your efforts.
